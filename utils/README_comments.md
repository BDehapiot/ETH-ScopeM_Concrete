- Fading images in reg_stack 
    - expl `D1_ICONX_DOS_reg_norm.tif` z=70 t=3
    - expl `D12_ICONX_Corrosion_reg_norm.tif` z=70 t=3
- Bin fluctuation from timepoint to timepoint
    - Maybe analyse only the fully overlaping region of reg_stack 
    - Maybe exclude bins with not enough data-points
- Consistent bin range (avoid disapiring bin range (e.g 0-10))
